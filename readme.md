### the goal  
don't u want to talk to claude using voice?  
aren't u sad that claude's memory of ur projects together disappear chat after chat?  
are u having identity crisis ctrl c v ing into claude, questioning whether ur just a ai wrapper?  

ur not just a ai wrapper, but this website is  
this website tries to make the best user experience possible for different chatbots, mostly claude  

### functionality to implement  
voice chat: (includes different UI options: voice -> voice, voice -> text, text -> voice)  
video chat: shares screen or camera, takes set time screenshots and when user presses send  
persistant memory: stores all chat in summary format. model can look up past memory as rag. (i.e. rough idea of all the projects done together or in depth conversation had together)  


### potential functionalities less likely to implement  
twitter profile link: reads your posts, comments on them maybe in chat, and learns more about you  
internet search  
agentic computer use  (code editor, build into app to test code, do this in the cloud, but can take screenshots for models to use)  
CVM: claude virtual machine. rent it a virtual machine in the claude, let it control it with virtual screenshots and actions.
